### Hi there 👋

My name is Gabriel Monaco, and I'm a Brazilian geologist 🌎🌍🌏. I earned my bachelor's degree in 2021 and my master's degree in 2024 from the **Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS)** 👨🏼‍🎓👨🏼‍🎓👨🏼‍🎓.

- 🔭 I am currently working as a researcher at the InTRA Laboratory of the Polytechnic School of the University of São Paulo (POLI-USP), affiliated with the Departments of Mining and Petroleum Engineering, on data science projects related to the energy industry.
  
- 🌱 During my master's, I studied the use of computer vision and neural network techniques for applications in digital petrography. I developed super-resolution models to reduce the trade-off between details and petrographic context in microscopic images of sealing mudstones from hydrocarbon deposits.
  
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving geology and artificial intelligence.

- 💬 Ask me about geology, digital petrology, image processing, computer vision, neural networks and data science.
