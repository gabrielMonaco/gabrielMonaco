### Hi there 👋

My name is Gabriel Monaco da Silva and i'm a geologist 🌎🌍🌏 graduated from UFRGS in 2021 👨🏼‍🎓👨🏼‍🎓👨🏼‍🎓

- 🔭 Today I'm doing a master's degree in geology at UFRGS, working with computer vision 🔬💻 for the task of segmenting the constituents of fine sedimentary rocks, in the study of their sealing properties in hydrocarbon deposits
  
- 🌱 I am currently studying architectures for semantic segmentation that use different types of artificial neural networks, like deep, convolutional and transformer. And learning how to use Pytorch 🔥🔥🔥 and Transformer libraries from HuggingFace 🤗🤗🤗
  
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any project involving geology and artificial intelligence

- 💬 Ask me about geology, digital petrology, image processing, computer vision and artificial intelligence
